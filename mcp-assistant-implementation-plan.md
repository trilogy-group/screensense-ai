# MCP Assistant Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing a new Model Context Protocol (MCP) assistant in the ScreenSense AI application. The MCP assistant will connect to external MCP servers that expose various tools like Google search, weather forecasts, etc. The assistant will integrate these tools with the Gemini model to provide enhanced capabilities.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Setup and Configuration

1. **Create MCP Assistant Configuration**
   - Add a new assistant mode in the `assistant-configs.ts` file
   - Define the system instruction for the MCP assistant
   - Configure initial UI elements and display requirements

2. **Create MCP Client Integration Module**
   - Create a new module in `src/services/mcp-client.ts` to handle MCP protocol communication
   - Implement methods to fetch available tools from MCP servers
   - Implement methods to execute tool calls via MCP servers

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Add necessary environment variables for MCP server endpoints
   - Update `.env.example` with the new variables

### Phase 2: Core Implementation

1. **MCP Tool Handler**
   - Create a new component in `src/components/tool-handler/MCPToolHandler.tsx`
   - Implement logic to pass MCP tools to Gemini
   - Handle tool execution responses from MCP servers

2. **MCP Orchestrator**
   - Create a new orchestrator in `src/agents/mcp-orchestrator.ts`
   - Implement the logic to manage the conversation flow
   - Handle tool selection and execution based on user queries

3. **Tool Registration System**
   - Implement a dynamic tool registration system that can adapt to tools exposed by MCP servers
   - Create interfaces for MCP tool definitions

### Phase 3: UI and User Experience

1. **MCP Assistant UI**
   - Update the control tray to include the MCP assistant option
   - Create any specific UI components needed for the MCP assistant
   - Implement proper state management for the MCP assistant mode

2. **Response Rendering**
   - Enhance the response rendering to handle MCP tool outputs
   - Implement any special formatting needed for MCP-specific responses

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement robust error handling for MCP server communication issues
   - Create user-friendly error messages for MCP-related errors

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement

1. **Integration Testing**
   - Test the MCP assistant with various MCP servers
   - Verify all tools are properly exposed and functional

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize the communication between the application and MCP servers
   - Implement caching if necessary to improve response times

3. **User Experience Refinement**
   - Gather feedback on the MCP assistant experience
   - Make adjustments to improve usability and effectiveness

## Technical Design

### MCP Assistant Configuration

```typescript
// Addition to assistant-configs.ts
mcp_assistant: {
  display_name: 'MCP Assistant',
  tools: [], // Will be dynamically populated from MCP server
  requiresDisplay: true,
  systemInstruction: `You are ScreenSense AI, operating in MCP Assistant Mode.
  
  Your role:
  1. **Primary Goal**: Help the user by leveraging tools provided by MCP servers.
  2. **Tools**: You have access to various tools exposed by MCP servers, such as search, weather forecasts, etc.
  3. **Capabilities**: You can dynamically adapt to the tools available from connected MCP servers.
  `
}
```

### MCP Client Service

```typescript
// src/services/mcp-client.ts
export interface MCPTool {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  parameters: {
    type: string;
    properties: Record<string, any>;
    required: string[];
  };
}

export class MCPClient {
  private serverUrl: string;
  
  constructor(serverUrl: string) {
    this.serverUrl = serverUrl;
  }
  
  async getAvailableTools(): Promise<MCPTool[]> {
    // Implementation to fetch available tools from MCP server
  }
  
  async executeTool(toolName: string, parameters: Record<string, any>): Promise<any> {
    // Implementation to execute a tool on the MCP server
  }
  
  // Convert MCP tools to Gemini tool format
  convertToGeminiTools(mcpTools: MCPTool[]): Tool[] {
    // Implementation to convert MCP tools to Gemini-compatible format
  }
}
```

### MCP Orchestrator

```typescript
// src/agents/mcp-orchestrator.ts
export class MCPOrchestrator {
  private mcpClient: MCPClient;
  private tools: Tool[] = [];
  
  constructor(serverUrl: string) {
    this.mcpClient = new MCPClient(serverUrl);
    this.initialize();
  }
  
  private async initialize() {
    const mcpTools = await this.mcpClient.getAvailableTools();
    this.tools = this.mcpClient.convertToGeminiTools(mcpTools);
  }
  
  async processUserQuery(query: string): Promise<string> {
    // Implementation to process user queries using Gemini and MCP tools
  }
  
  async handleToolCall(toolName: string, parameters: Record<string, any>): Promise<any> {
    // Implementation to handle tool calls via MCP client
  }
}
```

## Integration Points

1. **Main App Integration**
   - Update `App.tsx` to include the MCP assistant mode
   - Add state management for MCP server connection status

2. **Electron Main Process Integration**
   - Update `main.ts` to handle any MCP-specific IPC messages
   - Implement any necessary system-level integrations

3. **Tool Handler Integration**
   - Extend the existing `ToolCallHandler` component to support MCP tools
   - Implement proper routing of tool calls to the MCP client

## Considerations and Challenges

1. **Dynamic Tool Handling**
   - The system needs to adapt to different tools exposed by different MCP servers
   - Tool definitions may change over time and need to be refreshed

2. **Error Resilience**
   - Network issues or MCP server downtime should be handled gracefully
   - Users should be informed of connection issues with clear messages

3. **Performance**
   - Tool execution via external servers may introduce latency
   - Consider implementing caching or parallel execution where appropriate

4. **Security**
   - While authentication is not a current concern, the system should be designed with security in mind for future enhancements

## Future Enhancements

1. **MCP Server Selection**
   - Allow users to select from multiple MCP servers
   - Implement server discovery mechanisms

2. **Tool Customization**
   - Allow users to customize which MCP tools are enabled
   - Implement tool preference persistence

3. **Authentication**
   - Add support for authenticated MCP server connections
   - Implement secure credential storage

4. **Offline Capabilities**
   - Implement fallback mechanisms when MCP servers are unavailable
   - Cache frequently used tool results for offline use
